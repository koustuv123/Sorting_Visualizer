# Sorting_Visualizer
i build this sorting visualizer which simplifies learning sorting algorithms like bubble sort,insertion,quick sort,merge etc . I build this using simple javascript,css and html and anyone can catchup very easily and also i have been planing to add descriptive lines for each line of code ofcourse which are hard to understand.
